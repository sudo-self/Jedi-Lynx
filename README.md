LittleLink has more than 100 branded button styles you can use (with even more being added by our community). You'll also find a light and dark theme ready to go. Not a fan of the default colors? Update `skeleton-light.css` or `skeleton-dark.css` to the HEX values of your choosing. You can also set your CSS to `skeleton-auto.css`, which will use the system theme of the device you visit on.
